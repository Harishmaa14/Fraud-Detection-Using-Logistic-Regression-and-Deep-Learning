# Fraud-Detection-Using-Logistic-Regression-and-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in the credit card dataset (creditcard.csv) using two different classification approaches: Logistic Regression and a Deep Learning model. Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the original dataset, under-sampling techniques are applied to create a balanced subset, ensuring that both fraudulent and legitimate transactions are adequately represented. The Logistic Regression model provides a baseline with interpretable results, while the Deep Learning classifier—built with multiple layers and nonlinear activations—aims to capture complex patterns for improved detection accuracy. The models are trained and evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess their effectiveness in identifying fraud. This work demonstrates the comparative performance between traditional machine learning and deep learning techniques in a critical real-world application of financial security.
